                        Döner is a dish of beaten pieces of meat seasoned with suet, local herbs and spices, skewered on a spit and grilled vertically.
                        Leaves, thinly sliced pieces of döner, are served on pieces of pide, a pita like bread. Pide pieces are dressed with butter and tomato sauce.
                      Yogurt is added to the side of the plate, and if you please extra tomato sauce and butter to make it even more delightful.</p>

                      <p class="lead">Often called Turkish ravioli, mantı is a hot dish served with cold yogurt and garlic. You can think of mantı as some kind of dumplings consisting of the dough and its filling. In the classical Anatolian (Kayseri) style, the dough is made of water, flour and salt. Some add eggs to increase the flavor. The thinner the dough and the smaller the wrapped pieces are, the more masterful the cook is. The filling contains grounded beef or lamb, onion, salt and pepper.</p>

                      <p class="lead">This kebap is a must if you are a meat enthusiast.The ingredients are few, yet the process of preparing and cooking are specific. The essential ingredients are the lamb meat and the tail fat. Traditionally, it has to be the meat of a male lamb that is younger than one year of age. The animal has to be grown in its natural environment and fed with the local flora. After a detailed cleansing and resting process, the meat is kneaded with dried red and green hot pepper and fresh local red peppers, brochette mounted on the skewers, charcoal grilled and served on lavaş (a pita like thin bread) with grilled onion, tomato and green pepper on the side.</p>

                      <p class="lead">Picture of a typical Turkish breakfast plate in Istanbul, Turkey Turkish breakfast plate. The breakfast habits of Turks are slightly different than the Europeans’. For starters, tea replaces the coffee. Also sliced tomatoes and/or cucumbers are a must for a Turkish breakfast. The rest of the elements are similar. The most common type of bread is white bread. However, in an attempt to eat healthier, different kinds of grain breads like rye are commonly available these days. White cheese (similar to feta), old cheese (kaşar peyniri), black and/or green olives (zeytin), butter, thick cream (kaymak), honey, jam, an omelet or boiled eggs (yumurta) are regular players of the game.</p>

                      <p class="lead">Baklava is the finest example of the Turkish dessert passion. The ingredients (phyllo dough, nuts and syrup) are simple, yet craftsmanship is most definitely required. The thinness of the dough layers is crucial. The nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts or pistachios, vary from region to region in Turkey. The nuts are spread in between the layers of phyllo dough. Then the pile of dough is dressed with butter, baked and finally soaked in syrup.</p>

                      <h3><strong>Künefe</strong></h3>
                      <p class="lead">Künefe is a traditional Arab cheese pastry. The unsalted cheese in between the two layers of kadayıf is the essence. Kadayıf are thin fibers of dough, a simple mix of water and flour. It is served warm because it is freshly baked and soaked in syrup. This Turkish dessert has an amber color and is dressed with the grounded pistachio on top. The cheese melts inside and when you take a bite you sense different textures, such as the soft cheese and the crusty dough. I also like the way the cheese sooths the heavy sugary taste.</p>
